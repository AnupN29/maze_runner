# Maze Runner

Maze Runner is a Python project that implements various pathfinding algorithms for solving 2D mazes. It provides a graphical user interface for real-time visualization of the maze-solving process.

## Features

- **Interactive GUI:** Developed using Pygame for dynamic visualization.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms:** Implemented DFS, BFS, Dijkstraâ€™s, and A* (A-star) for optimizing maze navigation.
- **Object-Oriented Structure:** Utilized classes, modules, and packages for enhanced code organization.

## Usage

1. **Requirements:**

   - Python (version 3.10)
   - Pygame library (install with `pip install pygame`)
2. **Setup:**

   - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/maze-runner.git`
   - Navigate to the project directory: `cd maze-runner`
   - Install project dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the Application:**

   - Execute `python main.py` to launch the Maze Runner GUI.
4. **Choose Algorithm:**

   - Use the GUI to select a pathfinding algorithm and visualize its performance in real-time.
